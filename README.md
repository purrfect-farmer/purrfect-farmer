## 📦 Build Options

### 🔌 Chrome Extension (Standalone)

Build the standalone Chrome extension with all features included:

```bash
pnpm build:farmer
```

**Output:** `.crx` and `.zip` files in `apps/purrfect-farmer/dist-bundle`

**Installation:**
1. Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`
2. Enable "Developer mode"
3. Drag and drop the `.crx` file or load unpacked from `dist-extension` folder

**Note:** Requires a private key (`dist.pem`) in the project root for building `.crx` files.

### 🎯 Whisker Build

For integration with [Purrfect Whiskers](https://github.com/purrfect-farmer/purrfect-whiskers) (multi-account management):

```bash
pnpm -F purrfect-farmer build-whisker
```

**Output:** Extension in `apps/purrfect-farmer/dist-whisker`

Configure the extension path in Purrfect Whiskers settings to point to the `dist-whisker` folder.

```

**Output:** Static files in `apps/purrfect-farmer/dist`
