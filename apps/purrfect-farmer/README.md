## 📦 Build Modes

### 🔌 Chrome Extension (Standalone)

Build a standalone Chrome extension with all features:

```bash
pnpm build-extension
```

**What it does:**
- Compiles all extension components (service worker, content scripts, UI)
- Generates manifest.json
- Creates both unpacked extension and packaged files

**Output:**
- **Unpacked:** `dist-extension/` - Load directly in Chrome
- **Packed:** `dist-bundle/purrfect-farmer-v*.crx` - Installable extension
- **Zip:** `dist-bundle/purrfect-farmer-v*.zip` - For distribution

**Requirements:**
- Extension private key (`dist.pem`) must be in project root for `.crx` generation
- Generate key on first build or use existing key

**Installation Steps:**
1. Open Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions/`
2. Enable "Developer mode" (top-right toggle)
3. Option A: Drag and drop the `.crx` file
4. Option B: Click "Load unpacked" and select `dist-extension` folder

---

### 🦁 Whisker Build

Build for integration with [Purrfect Whiskers](https://github.com/purrfect-farmer/purrfect-whiskers):

```bash
pnpm build-whisker
```

**What it does:**
- Creates optimized build for multi-account browser automation
- Integrates with Whiskers' profile management system
- Enables advanced features like account rotation and bulk operations

**Output:** `dist-whisker/`

**Setup:**
1. Install [Purrfect Whiskers](https://github.com/purrfect-farmer/purrfect-whiskers)
2. Open Whiskers settings
3. Set extension path to: `/path/to/purrfect-farmer/apps/purrfect-farmer/dist-whisker`
4. Restart Whiskers to load the extension

**Benefits:**
- Manage multiple farmer accounts simultaneously
- Profile isolation for each account
- Scheduled automation
- Cloud sync support

---

### 🌐 PWA (Progressive Web App)

Build as a web application:

```bash
pnpm build-pwa
```

**What it does:**
- Creates a web-based version accessible via browser
- Generates service worker for offline support
- Includes PWA manifest for installation

**Output:** `dist/`

**Requirements:**
- Bridge extension must be installed separately (see below)
- Web server to host the files

**Deployment:**

**Local Development:**
```bash
# Serve the build
pnpm preview
# or use any static server
npx serve dist
```

**Production Deployment:**
```bash
# Using Nginx
sudo cp -r dist/* /var/www/purrfect-farmer/
# Configure Nginx to serve the directory

# Using Apache
sudo cp -r dist/* /var/www/html/purrfect-farmer/

# Using Node.js
npm install -g serve
serve -s dist -l 3000
```

**Installation as PWA:**
1. Open the hosted URL in Chrome
2. Click the install icon in the address bar
3. Or go to Settings → Install Purrfect Farmer

---

### 🌉 Bridge Extension

The Bridge allows PWA to access Chrome Extension APIs:

```bash
pnpm build-bridge
```

**What it does:**
- Creates minimal extension that exposes Chrome APIs to PWA
- Enables tab management, storage, and extension features
- Acts as middleware between PWA and browser

**Output:**
- **Unpacked:** `dist-bridge/`
- **Packed:** `dist-bundle/purrfect-farmer-bridge-v*.crx`

**Why it's needed:**
- PWAs have limited browser API access
- Bridge provides native extension capabilities
- Enables features like tab control and advanced storage

**Installation:**
1. Build the bridge: `pnpm build-bridge`
2. Load in Chrome (same process as extension)
3. Bridge must be active when using PWA

---

### 🔨 Build All

Build all variants at once:

```bash
pnpm build
```

This runs all build modes sequentially:
1. PWA
2. Extension
3. Whisker
4. Bridge

---

## 🛠️ Development

### Start Development Server

```bash
pnpm dev
```

**Features:**
- Hot Module Replacement (HMR)
- Fast refresh for React components
- Instant updates on file changes
- Development mode with debugging enabled

**Access:** Open `http://localhost:5173`

### Development Tips

```bash
# Clean build artifacts
pnpm clean

# Generate PWA assets (icons, splash screens)
pnpm generate-pwa-assets

# Lint code
pnpm lint

# Preview production build
pnpm preview
```

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Environment Variables

Create `.env.local` for local overrides:

```env
# API Endpoints
VITE_API_URL=https://your-fly-instance.com
VITE_API_VERSION=v1

# Features
VITE_ENABLE_ANALYTICS=false
VITE_DEBUG_MODE=true

# Build Options
VITE_PWA=false
VITE_EXTENSION=true
VITE_WHISKER=false
VITE_BRIDGE=false
```

### Extension Manifest

The manifest is generated dynamically during build. To customize:

Edit `plugins/generate-chrome-manifest.js`

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Extension Not Loading

```bash
# Clean and rebuild
pnpm clean
pnpm build-extension

# Check for errors in Chrome
chrome://extensions → Details → Inspect views
```

### PWA Not Installing

- Ensure served over HTTPS (or localhost)
- Check browser console for service worker errors
- Verify manifest.json is valid

### Bridge Communication Issues

- Confirm bridge extension is installed and active
- Check both extensions have matching versions
- Restart Chrome completely

### Build Failures

```bash
# Clear node_modules and reinstall
rm -rf node_modules
pnpm install

# Clear build cache
pnpm clean
```
